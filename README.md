We welcome contributions of new models. Please see our [contribution guide](https://jimgoo.github.io/metaflow-tabular/contributing.html) for more details.

### Code style

We use [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as a code formatter. The easiest way to ensure your commits are always formatted with the correct version of `black` it is to use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): install it and then run `pre-commit install` once in your local copy of the repo.
